# [Cesar Salgado's Personal Page](http://cesarsalgado.com)

This is a site I'm building for fun and for learning cool technologies.

I plan to add some information about myself, host some of my projects and maybe build a blog.

I'm also building this site while taking some online classes in sites such as codeacademy, udacity, coursera, and edx.

## TODO list

### Technology features to add

The purpose of this list is to write down items for technology features which I think I should use in my site for learning purposes.

html:
- table
- div
- span
