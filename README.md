# [Cesar Salgado's Personal Page](http://cesarsalgado.com)

This is a site I'm building for fun and for learning cool technologies.

I plan to add some information about myself, host some of my projects and maybe build a blog.

I'm also building this site while taking some online classes in sites such as codeacademy, udacity, coursera, and edx.
